Game Logic: Implements core Snake game mechanics, including movement, food generation, and collision detection.
Intuitive Controls: Provides a natural and accessible way to play the game.
Customizable Difficulty: Offers adjustable game settings for different skill levels.
Technologies:

Python: The primary programming language used for development.
SpeechRecognition - The library used for voice recognition.
Pygame - The library used for game graphics and sound.
How to Use:
